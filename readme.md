# 2048

2048 is a puzzle game where the objective is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach the number 2048.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the grid.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
- The goal is to continue merging tiles until you reach the 2048 tile.
- If the grid fills up and no more moves are possible, the player loses.
